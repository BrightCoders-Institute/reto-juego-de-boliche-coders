# El Juego de boliche

> [Ver instrucciones antes de iniciar](./instructions.md)

## Description.

The goal of bowling is simple – to knock down as many pins as possible. The more pins you knock down, the more points you score.

A single game consists of 10 “frames”, with each frame consisting of two chances to knock down ten pins (with the exception of the last frame).

Each pin you knock down earns you a point, while you can also score extra points by hitting “strikes” or “spares”.

Most bowling alleys today come with a computerised system that automatically calculates your score for you. However, in the past, bowlers had to record their score on a piece of paper and calculate it on their own. Today, some bowlers still prefer to write their score on paper, be it to keep track of their progress or in the event that the computer system breaks down.

## Strikes & Spares

A strike is when you knock down all ten pins at your first attempt in a single frame. Two strikes in a row are called a double, three strikes in a row are called a Turkey, while four and five strikes in a row are called four/five-bagger(s) and so on and so forth. A strike is commonly indicated with an “X”.

A spare is when you fail to knock down all ten pins at your first attempt in a single frame, but manage to clear the remaining pins at your second attempt. A spare is commonly indicated with a “/”.

Strikes and Spares are scored slightly different from regular frames – 

Spare: 10 points + the number of pins you knock down for your first attempt at the next frame.

Strike: score 10 points + the number of pins you knock down for the entire next frame.
